In this project, we had a singular data set that contained audio of emotions that were transformed into a tabular setting. In the data, we performed dimensional reduction and clustering analysis using different methods and explained the best. We associated the different clusters to indicate different emotions to see how different emotions can be very similar, We tested whether several emotions can be found in one message and also whether the beginning and end of each message are noise that may interfere with the correct identification of the emotions. After that, we found anomalies in the data using anomaly detection tools and tested whether these anomalies could give us some insight into the emotion expression to improve our clustering. Lastly, we propose a visualization that best characterizes the clusters we optimized. We concluded that Fuzzy C-means with LLE dimensionality reduction is the overall best algorithm, and that there is a difference within one message, and that the beginning and end of the messages are mostly an important part of it for the emotion detection.
